Jitter Physics
==============
A physics engine for .Net/Mono written by Thorben Linneweber and Matthew Bettcher and hosted [at Google Code](http://code.google.com/p/jitterphysics). I just made a backup of the original SVN repository due to Google Code shutdown announcement, so that anyone could find Jitter source code. Not sure about further development, though - I'm thinking about porting the engine (or some of its parts) to D language.
